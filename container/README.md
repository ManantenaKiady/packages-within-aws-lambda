# Welcome

In this solution, we build a custom runtime base on a Docker image to run spacy within AWS Lambda.

1) Clone the repository

2) Run docker build and tag the image 

3) Push the built image to ECR 

4) When creating a lambda function, we can choose container image and sue the ECR uri to our image.

Done!
